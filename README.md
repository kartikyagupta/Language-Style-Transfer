This repository showcases my work on Language Style Transfer (LST) as part of the partial fulfillment of my NLP course. The primary objective of this project was to develop a model capable of effectively transferring language styles between formal, casual, and humorous expressions.

### Overview
In the context of a 24-hour challenge organized by our professor, we were provided with a dataset containing sentences in formal language, each accompanied by two alternative versions in casual and humorous styles. The challenge involved creating a robust model that could successfully perform Language Style Transfer (LST) between these styles.

### Objectives
The main goals of the project were as follows:

1) Language Style Transfer: Develop a model that can convert text from formal language to either casual or humorous styles.

2) Dual Categories: Participants had the option to focus on one of two specific transformations:
   a) Formal to Casual
   b) Formal to Humorous

3) Methodology
* Data Preparation: The initial phase involved thorough exploration and preprocessing of the provided dataset. This step was crucial to ensure the model's exposure to diverse language styles and contexts.

* Model Development: Two approaches were explored for language style transfer:

1) GPT-2-based Model: Utilizing the pre-trained GPT-2 model to perform style transfer.
2) Custom Model Implementation: A bespoke model designed to address the unique challenges posed by the dataset.
Code Organization The codebase is organized to maintain clarity and coherence. However, due to the time constraints of the challenge, the files may not be perfectly structured. Efforts are ongoing to enhance organization and document the code comprehensively.

### Results
The effectiveness of the models in achieving language style transfer is evaluated, and the results are presented in the respective sections. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and improvements in the field of Language Style Transfer.
