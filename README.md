1. This repo contains the work I did for the partial fulfilment of my course NLP.
2. A 24 Hour Challenge was organized by our professor. The task at hand was **Language Style Transfer**.
3. we were given a dataset of formal sentences alon with 2 other versions of the very sentence in a **Humor** and **Casual**. 
4. Thus, the challenge at hand was to use the given dataset and create a model which is able to sucessfully transfer the language style.
5. As mentioned above, the 2 versions, namely Humor and Casual created 2 categories for the participants for the challenge.
6. They could either convert the text from
   a) Formal -> Casual
   b) Formal -> Humor
7. This repo is displays my work for the very challenge.
8. **NOTE:** I there is another implementation where I have my own model rather than the pre-trained GPT2. Given the chaotic nature of the assignment, I haven't been able to properly organize all the code files. Hopefully will upload the complete code file along with my model as well.
